# CP4 Problem Solutions Repository 🚀

Welcome to the **CP4 Problem Solutions Repository**! This repository serves as a personal documentation hub for solving problems inspired by the book **"Competitive Programming 4" (CP4)** and **LeetCode** challenges.

Every solution included here represents not only a step forward in improving my competitive programming skills but also my journey in tackling challenging problems with creative and efficient solutions. 🧠💡

## Purpose 🎯

The main goal of this repository is to:

- Document every problem I solve, along with my thought process and approach.
- Create a structured archive of solutions for reference and learning.


## Why CP4? 📚

The **CP4** book is a treasure trove of competitive programming problems and techniques. By working through its exercises, I aim to:

- Build a strong foundation in algorithm design and problem-solving.
- Explore advanced topics in data structures, graph theory, and computational geometry.

## Repository Structure 📂

The repository is organized into categories based on topics and problem types:

- **Dynamic Programming**: Optimizing solutions for problems with overlapping subproblems.
- **Graph Theory**: Tackling shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and more.
- **Data Structures**: Exploring efficient storage and retrieval methods.
- **Mathematics**: Applying number theory, combinatorics, and other mathematical concepts.
- **String Manipulation**: Handling problems involving pattern matching, text parsing, etc.

Each folder contains:

1. **Problem Statement**: A clear description of the problem being solved.
2. **Solution Code**: Well-documented source code with comments.
3. **Explanation**: A detailed breakdown of the solution approach.

## How to Use This Repository 🛠️

Feel free to browse through the folders and files to learn from the solutions. If you’re also working through CP4, compare your approaches and see how they differ or align with mine. Suggestions and alternative solutions are always welcome!
